What would be the main problem with the algorithm approach ?

The main problem with the algorithmic approach you used is that it relies on knowing the true positions of each fragment within the original DNA sequence. In real DNA sequencing, we never know where each read comes from, that is exactly what the assembly process must figure out. By recording the start index of every fragment and then sorting them, the algorithm “cheats” by using information that would be unknown in a real scenario. This makes the reconstruction trivial rather than a genuine assembly problem.

Another major limitation is that the algorithm’s overlap handling is too simplistic. It checks only for exact matches at the ends of reads and greedily appends fragments in sequence. Real DNA assembly is much more complex: reads overlap imperfectly, contain sequencing errors, and can match multiple regions in repetitive DNA. A proper assembler must identify all possible overlaps, build an overlap graph, and derive a consensus sequence. In addition, the algorithm assumes that all reads are error-free and unique, which is unrealistic. Real sequencing reads often include errors such as substitutions or deletions, and many parts of genomes are repetitive. These repeats can cause ambiguous overlaps that your current algorithm cannot resolve. In practice, assembly programs include statistical models or graph-based heuristics to distinguish between real overlaps and false matches caused by repeats or sequencing noise.

From a computational perspective, the approach is also inefficient and unscalable. A naive overlap search between all pairs of fragments requires quadratic time (O(n²)) as the number of reads increases. This quickly becomes infeasible when working with millions of reads from real sequencing runs. Real assemblers use efficient graph data structures such as de Bruijn graphs or k-mer indexing to reduce complexity and handle large datasets.

Finally, because the reads are chosen at random, there is no guarantee of full coverage across the entire DNA sequence. Some regions may not be sampled at all, leaving gaps in the reconstruction. Real sequencing pipelines calculate coverage depth statistically to ensure nearly every base is represented in multiple reads. In summary, the main conceptual flaw is that the algorithm is not a true DNA assembler, it works only because it uses positional information that would be unknown in practice. It’s useful as an educational demonstration of sampling, overlap, and reconstruction, but it cannot handle the complexity, ambiguity, or scale of real genome assembly tasks.
